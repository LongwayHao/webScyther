### ABSTRACT
As an important role of network security, the security analysis of security protocol is a matter that cannot be ignored. At present, researchers have developed a variety of formal analysis tools for security protocols, but there are some shortcomings in their use, such as complex environment configuration, cumbersome installation process and so on.
To solve these problems, the protocol analyzer of B/S system is developed on the basis of Scyther. The front-back stage decoupling method is adopted in the design, the front end uses React framework to render the page, and the back end uses Flask framework to develop the API, and Axios is used for the data interaction. The whole system realizes the functions of protocol input, protocol analysis and analysis result presentation.
This system makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional analysis tools and improve the convenience of protocol analysis, so that users can get rid of the terminal restrictions and analyze the protocol in a more intuitive and convenient way.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
